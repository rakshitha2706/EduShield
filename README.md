## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (Recommended: 3.10 or 3.11)
- **MongoDB** (Local installation or MongoDB Atlas account)
- **Modern web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd edushield

# Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Configure MongoDB

Edit the `.env` file:

```env
# For local MongoDB
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
DATABASE_NAME=edushield_db

# For MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)
# MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net
```

**MongoDB Installation:**
- **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt install mongodb`
- **macOS:** `brew install mongodb-community`
- **Windows:** Download from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- **MongoDB Atlas:** Free cloud option at [mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

### Step 3: Process Data & Train Model

```bash
cd backend

# Step 3a: Process the datasets
python data_preprocessing.py

# This will:
# - Load your uploaded CSV files
# - Engineer 23 features
# - Create processed_student_data.csv
# Expected output: "✅ DATA PREPROCESSING COMPLETE!"

# Step 3b: Train the ML model
python ml_model.py

# This will:
# - Train Random Forest Classifier
# - Display performance metrics
# - Save model artifacts
# Expected output: "✅ MODEL TRAINING COMPLETE!"
```

### Step 4: Start the Backend API

```bash
# Option 1: Using Python
python main.py

# Option 2: Using uvicorn (recommended for production)
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**API will be available at:** `http://localhost:8000`

**Test the API:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Step 5: Open Frontend Dashboard

```bash
# Option 1: Open directly in browser
# Navigate to: edushield/frontend/index.html

# Option 2: Serve with Python HTTP server
cd frontend
python -m http.server 3000
```

**Dashboard will be available at:** `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 6: Load Initial Data

Once the frontend is open:
1. Navigate to the **Model** section
2. Click the "🔄 Refresh" button on the Dashboard
3. The system will automatically load student data

Or use the API endpoint:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/batch-predict
```
